# SCUPP
Script Creation Utility for Pi Phone

A system to allow for simple creation of narrative storytelling through simulation of touch-tone phone menus.

Implementation goal is to have configuration of menus via xml and/or folder structure such that audio files can be easily placed to create audible menus without needing to edit code.

Ideal end use case is with Raspberry Pi placed inside physical touch-tone phone similar to Western Electric Model 1500/2500, with dialpad wired to GPIO and headset to headphone jack.
